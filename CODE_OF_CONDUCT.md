    A Code of Conduct for Open Source Communities
    ----------------------------------------------
    Participating in open source is often a highly collaborative experience. 
    We’re encouraged to create in public view, and we’re incentivized to welcome
    contributions of all kinds from people around the world. This makes the
    practice of open source as much social as it is technical.

    Some open source projects attract enough contributors that a community forms. 
    A healthy open source community centers the shared values and norms of its 
    members. While not all of these values are exactly the same from community to 
    community, there is a set of core values and norms that are essential in a 
    just and equitable software commons.
    
    Contributor Covenant is a code of conduct that you can adapt to express both 
    these fundamental shared values, and the special norms and values that 
    distinguish your own community.

    Adopting Contributor Covenant helps makes your community’s values explicit, 
    and signals your commitment to creating a welcoming and safe environment for 
    everyone.

## Our Pledge
We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards
Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community
include:

  - Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
  - Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
  - Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
  - Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,
    andlearning from the experience
  - Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall
    community

    Examples of unacceptable behavior include:
      
      - The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or
        advances of any kind
      - Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political
        attacks
      - Public or private harassment
      - Publishing others’ private information, such as a physical or email
        address, without their explicit permission
      - Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
        professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities
Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope
This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement
Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at [rajchakraborty.didhiti@gmail.com]. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines
Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

  - ### Correction
      Community Impact: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed
      unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.
    
      Consequence: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing
      clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the
      behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.
    
  - ### Warning
      Community Impact: A violation through a single incident or series of
      actions.

      Consequence: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No
      interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with
      those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This
      includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external
      channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or
      permanent ban.

  - ### Temporary Ban
      Community Impact: A serious violation of community standards, including
      sustained inappropriate behavior.

      Consequence: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public
      communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public
      or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited
      interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this
      period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.
  
  - ### Permanent Ban
      Community Impact: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community
      standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an
      individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

      Consequence: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the
      community.
